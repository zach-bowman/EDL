## Description
This repository contains the final submission components of the course-long EDL project. This project was created for and under the
instruction/guidance of the Electronics Design Laboratory course at JHU.
<br>
<br>
## Course Description
This will be a strictly project based class. I will propose projects that students will do in pairs. The projects will cover a wide range of subjects, ranging from image analysis and processing, through robotics control to VLSI design. All projects will require a heavy dose of computer usage (programming and simulation) and/or software/hardware design/implementation. The lectures will present background information on all the ideas we will encounter in the projects.

## Project Overview
ForgetMeNot is a memory aid designed to help users start the day with everything they will need. Its main functionality will be controlled by a sensor unit located near the front door of the home, and will utilize RFID tags to detect important objects. The device will also leverage wireless internet to provide quick communication and an intuitive interface in the form of a smartphone app. ForgetMeNot will be a user-friendly, home-integrated reminder system that will easily and effectively assist the user every day.
